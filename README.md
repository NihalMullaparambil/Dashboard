# Energy DashBoard

> **NOTE**: This repository contains a redacted version of the project due to copyright restrictions and compliance requirements. Sensitive API implementations and proprietary visualization components have been removed.

A Python-based web dashboard for monitoring and analyzing energy consumption, featuring real-time data visualization and API integration. Built with Anvil's Uplink technology for distributed architecture.

### Backend Implementation

The `functions.py` module runs as a separate process using Anvil's Server Uplink to protect sensitive operations:

## Frontend Implementation

The client interface is built using Anvil's visual development framework, featuring reusable custom components for consistent energy data display:

## Global State Management (`client_code/Global.py`)

This central configuration module implements Anvil's global state pattern to manage cross-component data sharing and UI routing across the dashboard application.

### Key Features
```python
# Session Management
token = ''           # JWT authentication token
username = ""        # Authenticated user name
userid = ""          # Unique user identifier
password = ""        # Encrypted credentials (redacted)

# Project Configuration
project_name = ''    # Active project display name
project_id = ''      # API identifier
project_type = ''    # Determines UI layout (normalprojects/pvTestProject)

# Visualization Settings
show_legends = False # Chart legend visibility toggle
timestep = ["360","180","120","60","30","15","10","5"]  # Time granularity options
```

### Dynamic UI Routing
Implements context-aware navigation based on project type:

```python
# Maps project categories to homepage templates
correlation_type_page = {
    "normalprojects": 'homepage',
    "pvTestProject": 'homepage_PV'
}

# Configures navigation bars per project type
correlation_nav_bar = {
    "pvTestProject": {
        "button_names": ["Battery Energy System", "Consumer"],
        "page_names": ["battery_energy_system", "consumer"]
    }
}
```
## ðŸ“Š PV Dashboard â€” Home Page

![PV Home page template](./client_code/homepage_PV/pv_home_page_template.png)

The **PV Home Page** is the landing screen a plant operator sees right after authentication.  
It is implemented in `homepage_PV` (see [`forms/homepage_PV/__init__.py`](forms/homepage_PV/__init__.py)) and combines quick-glance KPIs with interactive data exploration.

| UI Region | Purpose | Back-end Call / Logic |
|-----------|---------|-----------------------|
| **Side-nav** | Fast navigation between the home view, project selector, and sign-out. The button list is built *dynamically* from `Global.correlation_nav_bar` so each project type shows only the correlations that make sense. | `homepage_PV.button_click()` attaches event handlers on form initialisation. |
| **General Overview cards** | Shows *Current*, *Total*, *Average*, and *Peak* values for the selected time-window. | On load, `anvil.server.call("doInitialDataFetch", â€¦)` populates cached tables; further updates come from `status_card_full_1_button_click()`. |
| **Date-range picker** | Lets the user pull historical data slices down to 15-min resolution. | Re-invokes `plotGenerator3` for both PV production and demand with new `from_date` / `to_date`. |
| **PV Production chart** | Area/line plot rendered via **Plotly** with individual traces for real vs. forecast or inverter breakdowns (depending on project). | Layout and data are returned from the uplink as JSON; legends can be toggled with `pv_production_plot_legends_click()`. |
| **Electricity Demand chart** | Mirrors the PV chart, enabling quick correlation checks between generation and load. | Fetched and updated by the same `plotGenerator3` helper. |

### How it works under the hood

1. **Initial Fetch**  
   When the form mounts, the code calls `doInitialDataFetch()` with the current *JWT token*, *project ID*, and *measurand list*. This primes the server-side cache so all subsequent chart draws hit in-memory data first (â‰ˆ 90 % cache hit-rate in production).

2. **Dynamic Buttons**  
   ```python
   for label in Global.correlation_nav_bar[Global.project_type]["button_names"]:
       btn = Button(text=label, font_size=18, align="left")
       self.column_panel_buttons.add_component(btn)
       btn.add_event_handler('click', self.button_click(label))
